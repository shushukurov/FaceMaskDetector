# FaceMaskDetector

### Face Mask Detection system built with PIL, Pytorch using Deep Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to detect face masks in images and real-time video streams.

## Motivation
 Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

Face Mask Detection technology provides effective monitoring and enables proactive, real-time responses from your team. This advanced video-based detection technology is able to accurately detect objects in the camera’s field of view, classify them as humans and determine whether the subject is not wearing a mask.

According to WHO 'Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives'

## Project demo

Soon

## TechStack/framework used
Pytorch
FaceNet
MobileNetV2
PIL
OpenCV
FastAi
Flask
Docker
Microsoft Azure

## Features


This new feature relies on AI-enabled video analytics in the Enterprise Suite which determines when an individual is not wearing a face mask within your establishment. Once the feature detects an individual is not wearing a mask, this prompts an automated alert.

## Dataset

This dataset consists of 3800 images belonging to two classes:

with_mask: ~2000 images
without_mask: ~2000 images
The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

Bing Search API (See Python script)
Kaggle datasets
RMFD dataset (See here)
